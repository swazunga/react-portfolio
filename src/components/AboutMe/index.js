      <h1>About Michael</h1>
      <p>
        I am currently a QA Specialist at a healthcare IT company. I review the
        software built by the development team before it is deployed to
        production. I am seeking a position to be a developer, so I can expand
        on my skill set. I have experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I
        attended college in Birmingham, AL at Samford University with a major in
        Language & World Trade. My language of choice was Spanish, and I am
        expanding into computer languages. In my free time, I like to snowboard,
        wakeboard, and play poker. I am also a licensed real estate agent in the
        state of Florida.
